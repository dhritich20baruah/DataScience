I am teaching electronics in udemy. Here are the video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:
[{"title":"555-led-flasher","number":"13","start":242.0,"end":537.0,"text":"On the 555, a resistor of your choice goes between positive and pin 7. A second resistor of your choice goes between pin 7 and pin 6, then a capacitor between pin 6 and the negative will also connect pin 2 to pin 6. There's a switch inside the chip that connects pin 7 to negative. Right now that switch is open, it's not connecting pin 7 to ground. So electrons start flowing through the resistors to the capacitor. See, if we hook up a capacitor to a resistor and then power it up, those electrons flood onto the capacitor plates, but at a slower controlled rate because the resistor resists the flow of current. The voltage on the capacitor will climb until it reaches supply voltage. So the larger the resistor, the longer it takes for that capacitor to charge up because you're limiting how many electrons can get onto it. And it can only stuff so many electrons onto its plates. So if we were to graph the voltage, it would look like this. It stops when it reaches the supply voltage. Inside the 555, there's a little circuit that monitors the voltage on pin 6. When that voltage gets high enough, pin 6 screams to the rest of the chip, okay, we're there, and then throws the switch on pin 7 which connects pin 7 to negative. There is a second switch which is connected to that switch, and it connects pin 3 to positive, the positive supply voltage. So the capacitor is holding a positive charge, and so it begins to discharge through resistor R2. Down to zero volts through the switch on pin 7. Pin 2, in the meantime, is monitoring the voltage on the capacitor as well, but it's looking for zero volts. So when the voltage gets low enough, pin 2 screams to the rest of the circuitry inside the chip, hey, we're at zero volts, hit it! It then throws open that switch on pin 7."},{"title":"555-led-flasher-part2","number":"14","start":304.0,"end":446.0,"text":"With any circuit, you always hook up the power last, so we're going to hook up the power to these rails, or on these boards, the rows you designated for power. We're just planning ahead. So the first two connections are pin 8 and pin 4. They both need to go to the positive rail or the positive row, so use a jumper wire to connect them to positive. You can connect pin 4 to pin 8 if you think that's easier. Next, connect pin 1 to negative with a jumper wire, and now connect a jumper wire from pin 2 to pin 6. You're going to need two resistors and a capacitor. Find a capacitor rated at 4.7 microfarads, so remember the micro is that funny Greek letter, it looks like a U with a tail on it. You'll also need two 10k resistors, what are the color codes for them? Brown, black, orange if it's a 3 banded resistor, brown, black, black, red if it's a 4 banded precision resistor. You can pause the video if you've got to go hunting for them and want to build along with me."},{"title":"555-led-flasher","number":"13","start":547.0,"end":797.0,"text":"There is now no connection between pin 7 and negative, and remember that switch is connected to the pin 3 as well, which connects pin 3 to negative. So now the circuit starts charging the capacitor again from the positive supply voltage through R1 and through R2. Eventually pin 6 sees a high enough voltage, he throws the switch on pin 7 which starts discharging the capacitor and also connects pin 3 to positive, etc. So as you can see, you get a pulse train out of pin 3, and the timing of those pulses is determined by you choosing the resistors and the capacitor. A bigger capacitor, or bigger resistors, makes a nice slow pulse rate. Smaller resistors, or a smaller capacitor, makes a fast pulse rate. So you can do all kinds of things with this pulse train now. The first thing we're going to do is use it to flash an LED. So here's the schematic drawing of the circuit we're going to build. Notice that the chip, represented by a square or rectangle, has the pins all over the place. This is the norm when it comes to schematics. I have seen some schematics where the chip outline was drawn and the pins in the schematic were located where they are in real life on the chip, but schematic diagrams are descriptive of the circuitry, not the components. So right off the bat, in the schematic we've got pin 4 connected to pin 8, and the drawing shows them right beside each other. Obviously they are not in real life. Also, make note of how you can interpret the schematic."}]

"Where does the video talk about resistors"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way, where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course.
