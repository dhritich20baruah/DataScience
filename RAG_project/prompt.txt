I am teaching electronics in udemy. Here are the video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:
[{"title":"555-led-flasher-part2","number":"14","start":19.0,"end":31.0,"text":"Either one is correct. So crack out your breadboards and parts, grab one of your 555 timer chips and locate pin number 1. Something I highly recommend doing is orienting your breadboard a certain way."},{"title":"555-led-flasher","number":"13","start":10.0,"end":18.0,"text":"We are going to use a microchip called the 555 timer. You should have three of them in your kit. You look for the number 555, it will probably be NE555, but any 555 will do!"},{"title":"555-led-flasher","number":"13","start":32.0,"end":44.0,"text":"Let's face it, you got into electronics because you wanted to make things light up or make noise. You're getting into robotics because you want to make things move. Well the 555 can help with all of that."}]

"Tell me about the 555 timer"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way, where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course.
