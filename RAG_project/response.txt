The 555 timer is a versatile microchip that is a staple in the world of electronics, and we cover it in detail across two videos in this course!

Here is where you can find information about it:

1.  **Introduction and Identification (Video #13: "555-led-flasher"):**
    *   Starting at **00:10**, I introduce the chip and mention that you should have three of them in your kit. I explain that while the chip is usually labeled **NE555**, any 555 variant will work for our projects.
    *   From **00:32 to 00:44**, I talk about why this chip is so popular: it’s the key to making LEDs light up, creating noise, or even making things move in robotics. If you want to understand its practical applications, this is the best place to start.

2.  **Getting Started with the Hardware (Video #14: "555-led-flasher-part2"):**
    *   Once you’re ready to start building, jump to **00:19** in this video. I'll guide you through the physical setup, including how to orient your breadboard and, most importantly, how to **locate Pin 1** on the chip so you can wire it correctly.

I recommend starting with **Video #13** to get a feel for what the chip does before moving on to the hands-on assembly in **Video #14**. Happy building!
