Hi there! That’s a great question. Resistors are a fundamental part of the 555 timer circuit we are building, and I cover them in two different ways across both videos 13 and 14.

Here is exactly where you can find that information:

**1. Theoretical Explanation & Function (Video 13)**
In the video titled **"555-led-flasher" (Video #13)**, I spend quite a bit of time explaining how resistors work within the circuit:
*   **From 04:02 to 08:57:** I explain where to place the resistors (between the positive rail, pin 7, and pin 6). I also go into detail about how the resistor "resists" the flow of current to control how fast the capacitor charges.
*   **From 09:07 to 13:17:** I wrap up by explaining how the size of the resistor directly affects your results—specifically, how **larger resistors** create a slower pulse and **smaller resistors** create a faster pulse.

**2. Practical Selection & Color Codes (Video 14)**
In the follow-up video, **"555-led-flasher-part2" (Video #14)**, we get more hands-on:
*   **From 05:04 to 07:26:** I talk about the specific components you need for the build. I mention that you'll need **two 10k resistors** and, importantly, I explain how to identify them using their **color codes** (Brown, Black, Orange for standard, or Brown, Black, Black, Red for precision resistors).

**My recommendation:** 
If you want to understand **why** we use resistors to control timing, go to **Video 13 at the 4-minute mark**. If you are ready to start building and need help **identifying** the right resistors in your kit, jump to **Video 14 at the 5-minute mark**.

Happy building! Let me know if you have any other questions about the components.
